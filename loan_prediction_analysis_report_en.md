## Exploratory Data Analysis Key Findings

### 1. Feature-Target Relationship Analysis

#### Numerical Features Analysis
| Feature | Approved Mean | Rejected Mean | Significance |
|---------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| ApplicantIncome | 5,384 | 5,446 | Small difference |
| CoapplicantIncome | 1,505 | 1,878 | Moderate difference |
| LoanAmount | 144 | 151 | Small difference |
| Credit_History | **0.98** | **0.54** | **Highly significant** |

#### Key Insights
1. **Credit_History is the most important predictor**
   - 98% of approved loans have good credit history
   - Only 54% of rejected loans have good credit history

2. **Income factors show complex relationships**
   - Applicant income has minimal impact on approval rates
   - Co-applicant income is paradoxically higher in rejected cases, suggesting confounding factors

3. **Loan amount differences are minimal**
   - Average loan amounts are similar between approved and rejected applications
   - Indicates amount is not a primary decision factor

### 2. Categorical Features Insights
- **Gender Distribution**: 79.6% Male, 18.2% Female
- **Marital Status**: 65.0% Married applicants
- **Education Level**: 78.1% Graduates
- **Employment Type**: 86.2% Non-self-employed
- **Property Area**: 37.9% Semi-urban (highest)

### 1. Missing Value Treatment
- **Categorical Variables**: Mode imputation
  - Gender: 'Male'
  - Married: 'Yes'  
  - Dependents: '0'
  - Self_Employed: 'No'

- **Numerical Variables**: Median imputation
  - LoanAmount: 128.0
  - Loan_Amount_Term: 360.0
  - Credit_History: 1.0

### 2. Feature Encoding
- **Label Encoding**: Binary categorical variables (Gender, Married, Education, Self_Employed)
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Multi-class categorical variables (Property_Area)
- **Special Handling**: Dependents '3+' converted to 3

### 3. Feature Engineering
Created 7 new features to enhance model performance:
1. **TotalIncome**: ApplicantIncome + CoapplicantIncome
2. **LoanAmountToIncomeRatio**: LoanAmount / TotalIncome
3. **LoanAmount_Log**: log(LoanAmount + 1)
4. **TotalIncome_Log**: log(TotalIncome + 1)
5. **IncomePerDependent**: TotalIncome / (Dependents + 1)
6. **EMI**: LoanAmount / (Loan_Amount_Term / 30)
7. **EMIToIncomeRatio**: EMI / TotalIncome
